# Medical Classifier

In this project, we use TAN Classification (Tree Augmented Na√Øve Bayes) to learn the best relationship between medical symptoms and produce the most likely cancer prognostic for the patient. We use a medium-sized database for the model to learn.
Once learning is complete a patient's record can be inserted to estimate the prognostics.

Although this classifier can be used for many medical prognostic studies (breast cancer, diabetes, hepatitis, ...) its design is not limited to the realm of Medicine.
One could input data from other areas and the program would work as well, in this case relating the new variables to the given outputs and training in a new unknown field.
