<b>Medical Classifier</b>

In a world where more and more we hear people talking about AI's and their role and applications in every aspect of our lives, it is important to understand how such systems and algorithms are designed.

The end result of this project uses TAN Classification (Tree Augmented Na√Øve Bayes) to learn how to best relate input variables, in this case, medical symptoms, in order to get the most likely outputs (patient's prognostic). This is achieved with a medium/large database from where the program can learn.
Once learning is complete the classifier can be uploaded and a patient's record inserted in order to know the outcome.

Although this classifier can be used for many medical prognostic studies, such as breast cancer, diabetes or hepatitis its design is not limited to the realm of Medicine. Actually, one could input data from other areas and the program would work as well, in this case relating the new variables to the given outputs and training in a new unknown field.
