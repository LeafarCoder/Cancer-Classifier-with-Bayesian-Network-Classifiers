# Medical Classifier

In this project, we use TAN Classification (Tree Augmented Na√Øve Bayes) to learn how to best relate input variables (medical symptoms, in this case) to get the most likely output for the patient's prognostic. This is achieved with a medium-sized database from where the model can learn.
Once learning is complete a patient's record can be inserted to compute the cancer prognostics.

Although this classifier can be used for many medical prognostic studies (breast cancer, diabetes, hepatitis, ...) its design is not limited to the realm of Medicine.
One could input data from other areas and the program would work as well, in this case relating the new variables to the given outputs and training in a new unknown field.
